# EE368-MoodleProject
This repository contains the updated moodle features in separate branches. The updated features are: Bulk Enrollment, Course Progress Bar, Force User Login, and Stricter Passwords.

# Known Bugs:
In the task-5 branch, the bulkenrol feature has a bug where if a row shows an error in the preview window, then the whole row won't be shown on screen. This isn't a bug that affects functionality, only visual. The administrator is still given the row number and which columns are improper so that they can be edited.
